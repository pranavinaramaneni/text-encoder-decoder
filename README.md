# text-encoder-decoder
A Java-based console application that allows users to encode and decode text using a customizable Caesar cipher (shift-based encryption). The program features a menu-driven interface to encode messages, decode messages, change the shift value, view the current shift, and exit. Ideal for learning basic cryptography and text manipulation in Java.
